**appx2md** is a simple PowerShell script that gets installed AppX packages and puts them in a Markdown file. This script generates GitHub-compliant Markdown files.

## Usage

**NOTE:** admin privileges are required for the script to function

First, download the script by cloning the repository or by copying its source code to another file. If you receive a security warning, allow it. When run with no parameters, you'll see the usage instructions:

```
appx2md - Version 1.0
Script that gets installed AppX packages and puts them in a Markdown file.

USAGE:

        appx2md.ps1 [winbuild] [output] [mountdir]


    [winbuild]        The Windows build number that identifies the output Markdown file. You can either specify the build number, or use
                      "auto" to let the program determine the build number.

    [output]          The location of the Markdown file. Please specify a full path.

    [mountdir]        The mount directory to get the AppX packages from. You can either specify a full path to the mount directory, or use
                      "online" to get the packages from an online installation.

EXAMPLES:

        appx2md.ps1 19045 C:\docs online

        appx2md.ps1 auto C:\docs C:\WIP_Canary\mount

```

- ``[winbuild]`` is used to give a name to the Markdown file. If you don't know the Windows build you're dealing with, pass ``auto`` to let the script detect the build for you
- ``[output]`` is the location of the Markdown file, for which you need to specify a full path
- ``[mountdir]`` is the mount directory of the Windows image, which can be a full path or your active installation (pass ``online`` for the latter to occur)
